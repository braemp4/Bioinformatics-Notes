### Review of basic stats for intuition


**Data Types** 
- Numerical
    - Continuous or Discrete 
- Categorical
    - Nominal (no order) or Ordinal (ordered categories)
- Proportions
    - Frequency of categorical data 
    - If we have a binary category we can take the percentage of class 0 or 1

**Distributions**
- Probability density function - distribution of population between the two extremes (i.e. shortest and tallest where most people are in the middle)
- Normal distribution - low proportion of extremes and high proportion in the middle (bell curve)
- Uniform distribution - equal chance of selecting each value 
- Bimodal - two peaks

**Sampling and Estimation**
- Sampling makes the probability distribution less wide (more likely to select the mean value)
    - Variance is reduced
- By taking a sample we can estimate a paramter of the population - but this will never be the exact value
- We can use a confidence interval to estimate our uncertainty for that estimate
    - The sample size influences the confidence interval - small sample = wider confidence interval (more uncertainty)

**Common Parameters To Estimate**
- Mean 
- Standard Deviation
    - Variation or spread of distribution
- Proportion
- Correlation between two variables 
- Gradient between two variables

**Hypothesis Testing**
- Null hypothesis - by default we assume nothing is going on
- Alternate hypothesis - there is a connection between the data and what we're looking for 
- How to test (conceptually) - given the null hypothesis value (lets say a mean that equals 10 kg), and given the sample size what is the probability distribution we would expect
- If the data falls at the extremes of the probability distribution (low p value) we can say the data is not being explained by random chance (usually we use 5% of the distribution i.e. p value = 0.05)
- If p < 0.05 then we can reject the null hypothesis
- else there is not enough evidence!

**p-values**
- Hypothesis tests - is data extreme enough to reject the null
- p-values - how extreme our sample is OR how STRONG is the evidence of rejecting the null hypothesis
